                <p>Department of Health Research (DHR/ICMR) is the Secretariat of HMSC and facilitates technical review of the international collaborative proposals for placement before this Committee as a mandatory requirement. The domain for HMSC is: <a href="https://hmsc.dhr.gov.in/">https://hmsc.dhr.gov.in/</a></p>
            <p>As per the revised Terms of Reference (ToRs), the reconstituted HMSC will carry out the screening and clearance of proposals involving international collaboration/funding in health research including studies in humans, animals, plants and environment for entities pertaining to non Governmental Organizations. Committee will meet at least every two months to clear projects received for HMSC’s consideration. <a href="https://main.icmr.nic.in/sites/default/files/upload_documents/MoHFW_order.pdf">MoHFW order</a>

</p>    
<p>An integrated portal named Biological Research Regulatory Approval Portal (BioRRAP), coordinated by DBT,GoI, is to provide regulatory information to researchers and facilitate approvals. It is one-of-a-kind gateway intended to make science and scientific research more accessible as well as making it easier to create businesses. For any proposal to be submitted henceforth for HMSC consideration, it has been made mandatory by GoI to register through BioRRAP for a unique BioRRAP ID and then submit the proposal on the HMSC portal with a valid BioRRAP ID. Further details in this regard are available at <a href="https://biorrap.gov.in">https://biorrap.gov.in</a>

</p>
<p>Additionally, it is mandatory for the ICMR scientists to apply for HMSC clearance for the international research projects in the area of health research requiring foreign funding and/or collaboration (even ones under bilateral programmes of other Indian Funding Agencies). The proposals submitted by ICMR Institutes / Centers should submit the recommendations of the Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) of their institute/centre.

</p>
<p>The research proposals submitted by Indian Principal Investigators through Call for Proposals mechanism under the bilateral MoUs signed by ICMR with international organizations/agencies (advertised by the concerned Technical Divisions of ICMR as and when decided by ICMR and the partner agency) will also be considered by the reconstituted HMSC.
